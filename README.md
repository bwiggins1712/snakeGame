Snake Game

This is a simple Python-based Snake game built using the `turtle` module. The game allows the player to control a snake, eat food to grow the snake, and avoid collisions with walls or itself.

Requirements

To run this game, you'll need Python 3.x installed along with the `turtle` module. The `turtle` module comes pre-installed with Python, so no additional installation is required.

   git clone https://github.com/bwiggins1712/snakeGame.git

2. Navigate to the game folder:
   cd snake-game

3. Run the game:

4. Gameplay:
   - Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to control the snake.
   - Eat the food (red circle) to grow the snake and increase your score.
   - Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's body.
   - Press `R` to restart or `Q` to quit when the game is over.
